## About me
---

I started to learn how to program about 5 years, but have decided to take the leap this year of becoming a proficient and competent Software Engineer. I am currently enrolled in the Backend Development program at [bloomtech](https://www.bloomtech.com). I really enjoy problem-solving and I am always trying to learn new things. I have experience using Java, C#, Python, JavaScript and Rust.

In my previous life, I have done a variety of jobs which included organic farming, driving trucks (CDL), and national community service ([AmeriCorps NCCC](https://www.americorps.gov/serve/fit-finder/americorps-nccc)). I have been fortunate enough to travel outside the U.S. three times with my furthest trip being to Australia when I was a teenager. One of my most difficult experiences physically and mentally was hiking the entire distance of the [Appalachian Trail](https://appalachiantrail.org/) in just under 7 months from Georgia to Maine (2,190 miles).

When I'm not coding, I enjoy various outdoor activities including but not limited to hiking, daily walks, and campfires.

## Goals
---
I have set a few goals to accomplish by the end of August which include...
- Create three (3) projects that will showcase my programming skills.
- Create a portfolio site that will host these three projects.
- Complete the Core portion on the CodeSignal Arcade coding problems.
- Complete 3 out of the 4 questions on the GCA
